name: wrapped
version: 0.1.0.1
category: Generics
synopsis: Provides a single standardized place to hang DerivingVia instances.
description: |
  This exports the newtypes 'Wrapped' and 'Wrapped1', which are meant to hold
  typeclass implementations derived from other classes (most frequently,
  'Generic' and 'Generic1').  If you implement a general instance of a class,
  add it as an instance for 'Wrapped' or 'Wrapped1', and users will be able to
  derive it uniformly as @deriving TheClass via Wrapped TheType@.
